Major features
==============

Ergonomics: limit tests not by probe count but by running time (+probe_count calibration +passes)
Multithreaded mode
Test to detect disk readahead


============
Pleasantries
============

Add global test: tests everything
Preheat queue in kaio mode: burn extra 5% of probes on preheating
In seq tests, split window in even chunks and generate one offset per chunks *randomly* inside its chunk
Support for BLKALIGNOFF, /sys/class/block/sda/alignment_offset
Print current results on sigint before exit
Automatize creating extent file
Tracktotrack test: make --maxcylsize first guess depending on path size
Generate HTML+SVG graph
Option to specify latency importance as coefficient for cncread/cncwrite
Validate options compatability (+help)
Test to detect min/max cylinder size and distribution
Make progressive probe_count in cncread/cncwrite
